<p>If the River Nidd and the brooks adjacent, in the vicinity of 
Knaresbro&rsquo;, up the valley to Ramsgill, near Pateley-Bridge, and near 
the adopted line, had not possessed the many water-falls, and given motion 
to the sixty-seven mills which they do;&mdash;or had the great landed 
proprietors, on the line now adopted been hostile to this all improving 
project, of this highly favoured and not less honoured, their native 
district;&mdash;or had the hand of Nature, when it varied the surface of 
our earth, no doubt for wise purposes, and formed those high hills, 
composed their bowels of any other substance than what it is;&mdash;or had 
the commercial necessities of Knaresbro&rsquo; and its neighbourhood not 
existed, and the slow progress of their redemption, compared with others, 
at one time of far less note, not been too apparent; then, perhaps, this 
project, commendable as it is, would have shared the same fate, during a 
season of sickness, which it did twenty years ago.</p>
<p>But since these falls of water do exist, and are always ready to lend 
their willing aid to turn the ponderous wheels which impart motion to many 
mill-stones and many thousand spindles, beyond the possibility of 
denial;&mdash;and since the great landed proprietors have expressed nothing
unfriendly to the <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>project, but, if any thing, the reverse, at 
this moment of national difficulties and distress, highly to their credit 
and understanding;&mdash;and since the all-wise hand of Providence hath 
permitted an unceasing demand in one place, and a never-failing supply in 
another, at distances perhaps the most suitable and interesting for a work 
of this kind; <a name="citationvi"></a><a href="#footnotevi" 
class="citation">[vi]</a>&mdash;and, considering the necessity which the 
commerce of this district so evidently requires in an improved mode of 
transporting, from place to place, its heavy weights, with despatch and 
cheapness; then there can be no doubt of the propriety of prosecuting a 
scheme of this kind, so long, as we believe, on substantial data, that the 
completion of it will reward the shareholder, and give to this place what 
it once possessed, and be the means of rendering it again the first 
district in the kingdom for the manufacture of linens.</p>
<h2><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.</h2>
<p>At a meeting held the 16th day of March, 1818, in the Town&rsquo;s-Hall,
at Knaresbro&rsquo;, your Committee were authorised to appoint a suitable 
person to take a survey of the country, in order to point out the most 
eligible line for a Canal to Knaresbro&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After various correspondence with different engineers, the choice of 
your Committee fell upon Thomas Telford, Esq. a gentleman of long 
experience, and of whose abilities, as a civil engineer, every reliance was
placed.&nbsp; About the latter end of May following, this gentleman visited
Knaresbro&rsquo;, viewed the localities of the place, took running and 
comparative levels over the shortest and most convenient ground, to the 
higher side of Linton-lock, and also towards Tadcaster.&nbsp; In the latter
direction, as being a more direct communication with the port of Hull, he 
fully recommended a close survey to be made, for which purpose he sent his 
assistant Mr. Palmer, who commenced the survey with such other assistance 
as he required, about the latter end of June, and continued surveying and 
levelling in various directions until the middle of September;&mdash;about 
this time your Committee became alarmed for the success of the intended 
Canal, both on account of the unfavourable ground between the town of 
Knaresbro&rsquo; and Ribston, and the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient 
head of water in a natural manner.</p>
<p>Besides at this time the elevated situation of Knaresbro&rsquo; above 
the Wharfe was ascertained to be 198 feet, equal to 22 locks of 9 feet 
each; and hence, even if water <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>could be obtained at a cheap rate, by artificial
means, the number of locks requisite for locking down into a navigable part
of the river Wharfe or Ouse, distant about twenty miles, would alone render
the project unadvisable, by swelling the expense of the work in such a 
manner as would totally destroy the expected advantages to be derived by 
the trade of Knaresbro&rsquo; and the surrounding neighbourhood, or leave 
little or no hopes for the shareholders receiving a fair per centage for 
their money embarked.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances your committee abandoned all further hopes of 
a Canal, and notwithstanding the funds then collected for the survey were 
exhausted, they relied on the same spirit which gave rise to the project, 
and felt convinced of the great utility and advantages of a Rail-way, if 
taken from a navigable part of the river Wharfe, and continued, passing 
Knaresbro&rsquo;, up the valley to Pateley-Bridge.</p>
<p>The object of extending the work thus far, was, in order to secure the 
back carriage of the lead, which is produced on a large scale in that 
neighbourhood, besides the excellent lime for agricultural purposes made at
Greenhow-Hill, and the very excellent stone to be had there for making and 
repairing of highways; together with the inexhaustible quantities of stone 
for all purposes of building, which by the accounts we have of it, cannot 
be excelled; and also the produce of many flax and cotton mills, all of 
which are turned by water, and hence more likely to increase in number than
diminish; the quantity of tonnage to be found in that direction, at a 
comparatively small expense in obtaining it, added to the tonnage of the 
lower end of the line, would, undoubtedly increase, not only the utility of
the work, as regards the country in general, but give a preponderating 
quantity of tonnage in a descending direction; the advantages of which were
so obvious to your Committee, that a survey nearly upon new ground was 
undertaken, and continued under very favourable hopes, till at length it 
was brought <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>within the compass of both plans and sections, and exhibited to 
your Committee about the latter end of January, 1819.</p>
<p>From which data, and what more Mr. Palmer was able to give Mr. Telford 
from his own observations, your Committee requested Mr. Telford to give his
estimates of the most advantageous manner of communicating this place with 
the navigable part of the river Ouse at Acaster Sailby, (this being at that
time the point fixed on at the lower end of the line) either by a double 
Rail-way only, or by a double Rail-way to the Brook Crimple, and hence by a
Canal to Acaster Sailby, taking the water from this brook as a supply, and 
forward from Knaresbro&rsquo; to Pateley-bridge, by a single Rail-way, with
passing places.</p>
<p>The separate expenses of each, as furnished by Mr. Telford, are 
below:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the foregoing estimates Mr. Telford has considered the Canal, with 
its locks and bridges, as suitable for the Humber Sloops, and the Rail-way 
sufficiently strong to admit of one ton and a half being carried by one 
waggon.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>When it was originally intended for the lower end of the line to 
commence at Acaster Sailby, it was unknown to your Committee that an Act of
Parliament existed, levying duties on merchandise on the River Ouse, after 
the same had passed the Wharfe mouth towards York; for the better 
information of the public, we insert as much as relates thereto.</p>
<h3>ACT OF THE 5TH OF GEORGE II.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;An Act for rendering more effectual an Act passed in the 13th 
year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the First, entitled an 
Act for improving the Navigation of the River Ouse, in the County of 
York:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That from and after the 24th day of June, 1732, all and every the
goods, wares, and merchandises, and other commodities, carried and conveyed
on the said River Ouse, above Wharfe mouth, except such manure, dung, 
compost, or lime only, as shall be water borne, and used and applied in 
tillage; and also except all timber, stone, and other materials, made use 
of in or about the works necessary for improving of the navigation of the 
said river, shall pay the tolls or rates following, that is to 
say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For every ton of wines and groceries, almonds, Areack brandy, 
cyder, cydar egar, hops, fish oil, line-oil, Florence oil, Seville oil, and
turpentine oil, rum, spirits, tobacco, vinegar, bacon, hams, sides, and 
pork; cases and chests by measure, china, coffee, cork, drugs, and 
medicines; dyers&rsquo; ware, (except logwood, copperas, and alum); flour, 
glass, (except green glass bottles); haberdashers&rsquo; wares, household 
furniture, iron wrought, linen, linen-drapers&rsquo; wares, lemons, 
oranges, and nuts; leather and calves&rsquo; skins; mercery ware, silk and 
woollen, paper white and books, garden seeds, salt, tea, and 
woollen-drapery <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>ware,&mdash;two shillings and sixpence 
respectively;&mdash;and so in proportion for any greater or less 
quantity.&nbsp; For every ton of cheese, flax, pewter, soap, marble, 
bell-metal, brass battery, and copper, two shillings respectively, and so 
in proportion for any greater or less quantity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For every ton of oak, bark, corn of all sorts, earthenware, green
glass bottles, iron cast and unwrought, lead white and red; paper, cap, 
white, and brown; grass-seeds, beans and peas, rapeseed, stone, tallow, 
tin-plates and wire; timber, oak, ash and elm,&mdash;one shilling 
respectively; and so in proportion for every greater or less quantity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For every ton of alum, copperas, logwood, brimstone, bricks, 
tiles, coals, hemp, hay, lime for building, lead, and turfs,&mdash;sixpence
respectively; and so in proportion for any greater or less quantity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For every firkin, pot, cask, or other vessel of butter, one 
penny.&nbsp; For every hundred of oysters, one penny.&nbsp; And that all 
other goods, not herein particularly rated, shall pay ad valorem, such 
rates or duties as shall be ascertained by the said commissioners, 
appointed by or in pursuance of the said former Act.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon as your Committee had clearly ascertained the existence of this 
Act, and its consequent increase on the tonnage of flax, a deputation went 
down to the Wharfe mouth, to examine the river, as far up as Bolton Percy, 
and found from their own observations, but more particularly from the 
information they collected, that vessels of seventy tons burden can 
navigate the river, nearly always once in twelve hours the whole year; and 
that, if a little improvement was made in the river at three places, which 
are rather too shallow for vessels of this burden, they might pass at all 
times without interruption; the deputation were also of opinion that the 
improvement was <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>practicable at a moderate expense.&nbsp; This 
deputation also examined the line below Bolton Percy, (see the map <a 
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>) and 
found it passed through the estate of Sir Wm. Milner Bart. near his 
residence, and over lands in his own occupation, consequently more likely 
to meet with his opposition than his approbation.</p>
<p>Under these accumulated circumstances, your Committee decidedly 
recommended a double Rail-way, to commence at a bend in the river, near 
Bolton Percy, (see the map) which will shorten the length of the original 
line about one mile and a half, and lessen the expense of the project at 
the same time; thence in a line, nearly straight, to Bow-Bridge, passing on
the South side of the village of Wighill, and close to the North end of the
village of Walton.&nbsp; Thence in a circuitous direction towards 
Wetherby;&mdash;but if the line was permitted to pass from the North end of
the village of Walton to the North side of Ingmanthorpe, the seat of 
Richard Fountaine Wilson, Esq. distant from his residence about four 
hundred yards, it would pass over very suitable ground, and shorten the 
length of the line five-eights of a mile more.&nbsp; By either of these 
lines it would cross the great North Road, near the Drover&rsquo;s Inn, 
then proceed on the North side of the village of Little Ribston, and by the
banks of the River Nidd, sufficiently high to avoid the broken parts, 
crossing the said river by a bridge, near St. Robert&rsquo;s Well, and 
thence proceeding along the Eastern side of the town of Knaresbro&rsquo;, 
ascending, in an uniform manner, to the level of the bottom of the 
High-Street, commonly called Bond-End; where it will most conveniently pass
behind, or on the West side of Mr. Wm. Clayton&rsquo;s house; or, if more 
desirable to the owners of property at this point, it is possible to pass 
it under ground, and enter the valley of the Nidd without affecting or 
destroying any property, except two or three old houses belonging to Mrs. 
Stubbs.&nbsp; The line, for a single Rail-way, will then wind along the 
North bank of <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>the valley, till it crosses the Nidd by another bridge, the clumps
of trees on Scotton Moor; from this point it will keep on very favourable 
ground along the South side of the river, passing half way between 
Killinghall village and Killinghall bridge; thence through the middle of 
Hampsthwaite village, and close by Wreaksmill crossing the Nidd again below
the village of Birstwith; after which it winds along the North bank of the 
River Nidd to Pateley-Bridge.</p>
<p>Your Committee having stated their reasons for abandoning the project of
a Canal, and recommending that of a Railway, and having also pointed out 
the adopted line, the next duty which presents itself to their notice is 
the Revenue;&mdash;the nature and quantity of Tonnage which is likely to 
come upon the line, and within the limits of its attraction;&mdash;and give
to each such a charge as will equally benefit the various consumers.&nbsp; 
Such as we conceive to be of the most general importance, first attracts 
notice, which is the article of</p>
<h3>COAL,</h3>
<p>Wherein there is little doubt but a saving of eight shillings per 
chaldron will, on the completion of the work, be effected&mdash;a most 
material object for the poor, and the general benefit of commerce.&nbsp; 
The rule by which this computation is made, compared with others we have 
seen, is very much on the safe side, but should a trifling mistake occur, 
we confidently believe that the decrease in the price of this article will 
very much enhance its consumption, without anticipating any increased 
demand at the lime-works and bleach-grounds, arising from an increase of 
business, which naturally follows the cheapness of carriage, and the rapid 
transport of goods from place to place.&nbsp; The increase of population, 
while speaking of this article, must not be omitted, since, in the last 
twenty-one years it hath increased from four to near seven thousand, 
including Knaresbro&rsquo;, Scriven-with-Tentergate, and <!-- page 14--><a

be delivered at Bolton-Percy for ten shillings per chaldron, or 8s. to 8s

<p>The present cost by way of Boroughbridge, is one pound five shillings, 
and hence the saving to the public on every ton, or chaldron of coals, will
be nine shillings, except the merchants&rsquo; profit.</p>
<p>By the foregoing statement the tonnage of the Knaresbro&rsquo; and 
Pateley-Bridge coal, when it reaches Knaresbro&rsquo;, will yield a revenue
of &pound;3200. annually, being 21,335 tons, at 2d. per ton, per mile, for 
18 miles, and the tonnage on the coal belonging the district up to 
Pateley-Bridge will be 6000 tons, for 6 miles, the average distance at 2d. 
per ton, per mile, or &pound;303. 0s. 0d. making together &pound;3503. 0s.

that of Corn; and although the town of Knaresbro&rsquo; and its vicinity, 
cannot complain of a scanty or contracted supply, nor yet of exorbitant 
prices, compared with their more western neighbours, the inhabitants of 
Craven, and the borders of Lancashire: who, at least must pay such suitable
advance as will compensate for a long and expensive land, or a longer and 
protracted water carriage, neither of which in all probability, can in 
these days of depression, bear a further reduction of rate.&mdash;Under 
these circumstances, knowing the soil in the <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>neighbourhood of 
Wetherby and Tadcaster to be rich and fertile, we feel some confidence that
corn and its produce in flour and meal, (which can so conveniently be 
converted by mills upon the line,) will soon become an article of tonnage 
in no small degree, nearly the whole length of the line; and thence being 
removed by land carriage from Pateley-Bridge to Skipton and other places 
further west, will be found cheaper than heretofore.&nbsp; The quantity of 
tonnage on this head is not so clearly ascertained, still it will have some
reference to the quantity of coals brought from Skipton into the 
neighbourhood of Pateley-Bridge, or the quantity of lead taken from 
Pateley-Bridge, to Ripon as either one or the other of these articles, in 
both directions must be considered back carriage, otherwise they could not 
be removed, as heretofore, at the usual low rates.&nbsp; From these data, 
and the fact of three waggons three days each week from Knaresbro&rsquo; 
towards Skipton, we believe the tonnage under this head in that direction 
will be three thousand tons annually, which being nearly the whole length 
of the line, or twenty-five miles at 3d. per ton, per mile, will yield a 
revenue of &pound;937. 10s.&nbsp; Being aware some doubt may arise as to 
the computation of this tonnage being correct, we feel no apprehension as 
to the result.</p>
<p>For while it must be admitted, that lead in this case ceases to be a 
back carriage, hence the expense of carrying corn from Ripon to 
Pateley-Bridge must naturally increase, whilst on the contrary, the expense
by the Railway must as naturally decrease; these two circumstances in all 
probability will fully support the estimate, if not greatly exceed it.</p>
<p>We now come to the present principal trade of the town and neighbourhood
of Knaresbro&rsquo;, which is that of dressing Flax and spinning Yarns; and
what first takes our notice upon the subject of tonnage, is that of</p>
<h3>FLAX.</h3>
<p>This article during the latter period of the late war, was dressed and 
manufactured here in greater quantities <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>than at present, 
probably owing to the profits upon it at that time being more adequate to 
the heavy expense of carriage, than they are now.&nbsp; The depressed state
of the trade since that period has caused one flax-mill, turned by water, 
to be converted into a corn-mill, no doubt to the detriment of others in 
that line; and two more, turned by the power of steam, to stand still, and 
become useless; whereas, if carriage could be considerably reduced upon 
this article, and also in that of coal as stated already there remains 
little doubt but this useless property would regain its former value, and 
additional employment be afforded to the increasing population of the 
neighbourhood; an object at all times deserving the notice of the opulent 
and rich, and which of late, hath, with partial success engaged the united 
efforts of the legislature.</p>
<p>In calculating on the tonnage of this article we have it in our power to
be more exact than on that of any named before, for every individual 
concerned with it, has made his own return, and which added together 
amounts to two thousand four hundred and forty tons, being for the town of 
Knaresbro&rsquo;, one thousand seven hundred; and for the neighbourhood up 
to Pateley-Bridge, seven hundred and forty.&nbsp; Hence the amount of 
revenue from this tonnage will be as follows:</p>

<p>By this statement it appears there is a saving of 8s. per ton from Hull 
to Knaresbro&rsquo;; and nothing seems to prevent the same ratio holding 
good from Hull to Pateley-Bridge; besides should the Flax come from Hull on
board the regular traders, it will in all probability arrive at the Wharfe 
mouth in two tides, and from thence to Knaresbro&rsquo; in eight or nine 
hours; but should the trade of Knaresbro&rsquo; attract the notice of the 
owners of steam vessels, its dispatch would doubtless be greater; and more 
in proportion it would benefit the trade of the place; in as much as 
cheapness of carriage and dispatch of goods whether manufactured or 
otherwise are the very sinews of commerce, and in such proportion as these 
are obtained, so will the wealth and prosperity of the town or 
neighbourhood be regulated.</p>
<p>In presuming upon any increase of tonnage on this head, we feel equally 
safe as on any other, or more so; for if the present mills turned by water,
and spinning Flax were found insufficient, some corn-mills might easily be 
converted, and in lieu of them, wind-mills might be erected, for which 
purpose many fine situations present themselves on both sides of the 
valley, where there is abundance of stone and lime always contiguous, which
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>would
render such erections less expensive than in many other places.</p>
<p>The next subject for our consideration, and which naturally follows the 
last, is the tonnage arising from manufactured</p>
<h3>LINEN,</h3>
<p>Which in former times when spinning was done by hand, was the staple 
trade of Knaresbro&rsquo; and its vicinity, but which, of late years has 
been much on the decline, perhaps owing to many causes.</p>
<p>The principal one we are disposed to believe, arose from the capitalists
originally engaged in that line becoming mill owners; and as mills for 
sometime did not increase by their numbers so rapidly as to glut the market
with their produce, the profits in that branch were better than the other; 
and as this became apparent, its effects soon spread; so that few more 
reasons are requisite to prove the fact, of the Linen Manufacture having 
given place to that of Yarns.</p>
<p>Another reason why it hath not made equal progress with other places, 
may be the length of time manufactured goods are on their passage to 
London, where there is a market for every thing every day; the port of York
is the only one where these goods have been shipped, and from what cause we
cannot say, but they have been frequently so long on their passage, that 
good connections have been entirely lost on that account; whereas if the 
Railway was completed, Hull would naturally become the port of 
Knaresbro&rsquo;, and all produce of its manufacture would reach Hull in 
two days, at a much less expense than at present, and London most probably 
in five or six days more.&nbsp; Thus it is highly probable an order from 
London might be executed and warehoused in eight days, or sometimes in half
that time; a convenience perhaps unenjoyed by any other place of the 
kind.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the manufacture of Linens here has <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>not till lately been 
carried forward in that variety, nor the great increase of Looms been made 
compared with other places, still the character of Knaresbro&rsquo; Linens 
is maintained, when brought into service.</p>
<p>With regard to the tonnage arising from Linens, it alone will not be 
considerable, but as it is one article of tonnage in a descending 
direction, we beg leave to class with it, that of Linen Yarns, for should, 
by this improved mode of conveyance, either of these increase in quantity 
in a descending direction, the other as naturally will decrease, and as a 
considerable proportion of Yarns made in this neighbourhood, finds a market
at Barnsley, and in that direction, it is presumed that along the Railway, 
and thence by a Barnsley boat, will be the cheapest mode of conveyance; and
in the reverse direction coal will naturally become an article of tonnage 
and traffic.&nbsp; Having already from good and safe data, stated the 
quantity of Flax likely to come on this improved line of conveyance, at 
2440 tons, and why a great proportion of it when made into Linens, Yarns, 
and Tow, should naturally be tonnage in a descending direction, we hope the
public will give us credit for estimating this tonnage, at 2000 tons, per 
annum, and which we will suppose to be all delivered at Knaresbro&rsquo;; 
hence the tonnage of it to Bolton Percy, will be 2000 tons, 18 miles, at 
4d. per ton, per mile &pound;600. per annum, in a descending direction.</p>
<p>We now come to that consideration belonging the tonnage arising from</p>
<h3>GENERAL MERCHANDIZE,</h3>
<p>Which will include every thing consumed for the support of the 
population, and which there is no occasion to dwell upon separately under 
respective heads.&nbsp; This tonnage is made up from entries of different 
individuals, and amounts to 1035 tons, per annum, in an ascending 
direction; 570 for the town of Knaresbro&rsquo;; and for the district, up 
to <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

as under:</p>

<p>Although the distance from Knaresbro&rsquo; to Pateley-Bridge is 
14&frac34; miles, still we have only rated it at 12 miles.</p>
<h3>TIMBER AND IRON</h3>
<p>Will also become articles of tonnage in an ascending direction, and 
although different when considered respectively, are in their application 
so liable to meet, that perhaps it may not infringe much on their 
respective rights if classed together for their amount of tonnage; the 
amount handed to us is composed of returns made by such individuals as are 
concerned in the trade, and although it does not form a conspicuous figure,
nor produce a great sum, still perhaps it is not the less likely to make up
its full share of increase; for with these, cast metal may be classed, and 
recollecting the great wear and tear in mills, machinery, and waggons on 
the Railway, the quantity is more likely to be doubled, in a short period, 
than that of any named before; the amount of revenue as at present 
calculated, would be 1250 tons, up to Knaresbro&rsquo; from Bolton Percy, 
being 18 miles, at 3d. per ton, per mile, is &pound;281. 5s. 0d.&nbsp; And 
for the district of Pateley-Bridge, the returns are 450 tons, taken at 12 
miles, at 3d. per ton, per mile, amounts to &pound;67. 10s. 0d. per 
annum.</p>
<p>Another article of tonnage both ascending and descending may be named, 
and on which some revenue may be expected to arise, although the data for 
estimating it may be greatly clouded; it is that of</p>
<h3>PASSENGERS.</h3>
<p>The market of Knaresbro&rsquo; is generally well supplied, and prices 
moderate, as they are in other equally fertile <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>districts, except in a 
few articles, such as poultry, butter and eggs; but the increase of price 
in these articles is the most felt during the Harrogate season, when large 
quantities are in great demand for that improving place.&nbsp; 
Contemplating the execution of this project, it would immediately afford a 
most complete opening for all produce of this kind, coming to the market, 
in an easy, comfortable, and cheap manner, from a neighbourhood which hath 
not before enjoyed such an advantage, and would bring with it a 
corresponding demand for such articles of merchandize as are sold at 
Knaresbro&rsquo;, and in daily consumption in all farm houses.&nbsp; 
Contemplating again the prospect of a steam conveyance from the lower end 
of the Railway to Hull, which is highly probable, it is only natural to 
suppose, that very few journies would be taken, by the inhabitants of 
Knaresbro&rsquo;, and its vicinity, by any other conveyance to Hull, 
because cheapness, expedition, and comfort would recommend it.</p>
<p>Having stated such as we can at present call the ascending tonnage, our 
next duty is to say what there is which presents itself, that we can rely 
upon for a descending tonnage, more than what hath already been treated 
of.</p>
<p>Of these we find a tolerable variety, and of some articles a never 
failing supply; viz. lead; stone for building; stone for highways; lime and
lime stone; slates; flags; oak bark; wood; cotton twist; Irish flax and 
linens; ashes and several other kinds of American produce; which if we 
treat of as they are respectively named, that of</p>
<h3>LEAD</h3>
<p>First takes our attention.&nbsp; This article from time immemorial has 
been extracted from the bowels of the earth, at Greenhowhill, near 
Pateley-Bridge, in large quantities, the greatest part of which, of late 
years, has been carted to Ripon, a distance of twelve miles, and thence 
shipped for Hull, at an expense of one pound per ton.</p>
<p>From good authority we are informed that these <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>mines produce annually,
3000 tons, out of which quantity 2500 will become tonnage along the 
Railway, as below:&mdash;2500 tons, 33 miles, 1&frac12;d. per ton, per 
mile, is &pound;515 12 6.</p>
<p>The advantage which the proprietors of these mines will derive from this
improved mode of conveyance, is made apparent, by the following 
statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>By this statement it appears there is a clear saving of 7s. 6d. per ton;
but should the freight and carriage at present be only 19s. instead of 20s.
as before stated, then the saving will be 6s. 6d. which is an object of no 
small moment, and contributes its full share of recommendation to the 
project.</p>
<h3>STONE FOR BUILDING,</h3>
<p>Next claims our attention: It is of various kinds and qualities, some 
about Birstwith is of a strong coarse grit, will bear an immense pressure, 
is well adapted for bridges, locks, wiers, &amp;c. but is not to be had in 
blocks large enough for pier works.&nbsp; There is another kind of stone at
Dacre-Pasture, of a much finer grit than the last, paler in colour, and 
well adapted for finer masonry, such as columns, pediments, &amp;c.&nbsp; 
Blocks of this kind may be had of large dimensions.&nbsp; Another kind of 
stone is found at Wilsill, in quality similar to that at Birstwith, but may
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>be 
risen in much larger blocks.&nbsp; When the Ouse-bridge at York was 
building, in 1818, the contractors for, or the inspectors of that work, got
some stone from this neighbourhood for the piers, and by a letter from Mr. 
William Craven, one of the inspectors, there is no doubt of its being fit 
for any kind of public works, as bridges, locks, &amp;c.&nbsp; The expense 
of land carriage from the quarry to Ripon was the sole cause why a greater 
quantity was not made use of.</p>
<p>There is another kind of stone found a little way above Pateley-bridge, 
well adapted for flags, window heads and soles, staircases, landings, 
tomb-stones, and grind-stones; but owing to the beds being thin, it is not 
well adapted for general building purposes.</p>
<p>At Fellbeck, near Smelthouse-mill, a slate quarry has lately been 
opened, which produces a slate of a darker colour than that of Idle, is 
very sound, lays well on, and will probably improve in fineness, if pursued
to a greater depth.&nbsp; A ton of it will cover about ten square 
yards.</p>
<p>Another Slate-Quarry, at Bouthwaite, near Pateley-Bridge, has recently 
been discovered; the produce of which is much superior to that of Idle; a 
ton of it will cover about 14 square yards.</p>
<p>All this stone and slate is immediately upon the adopted line, or can be
brought to it for 4&frac14;d. per foot, which, with the expense of carriage
to Bolton-Percy will cost at that place as below:&mdash;</p>

<h3>STONE FOR HIGHWAYS.</h3>
<p>This is found in immense quantities at Greenhow-hill, distant from 
Pateley-bridge two miles, it resembles a grey flint; the road from 
Pateley-bridge to Skipton is principally composed of it; it is hard but 
easily broken small, and after a little using almost resembles one entire 
stone; its use and extraordinary properties are not known to a great 
distance, particularly towards Ripon or Ripley; this may be accounted for 
in two ways&mdash;first, the hills in either direction are long and steep; 
and 2dly, other materials are just at hand, of a quality sufficient for a 
road where the forbidding ascents deny the frequent passing of heavy 
carriages.</p>
<p>This stone has been compared to that at Middleton-Tyas, near Richmond, 
and when analysed is found to be exactly of the same quality, although a 
little lighter in colour; it was compared to this merely to prove a 
corresponding property.</p>
<p>For it is a certain fact, that the Middleton-Tyas stone has been for 
some time, and is now, carted from the quarry to Northallerton and 
Brompton, distant 14 and 15 miles, for the use of their highways, at an 
expence of 8s. 2d. per ton to the former, and 9s. to the latter 
place.&nbsp; This fact is the more remarkable, since there has been a 
quarry open for many years, within 200 yards of Northallerton, but the 
stone is only of a common kind.&nbsp; From this circumstance, it is fair to
expect, that provided the stone of Greenhow-hill can be delivered at 
Bolton-Percy for 6s. 6d. per ton, and at Cawood, Selby, Booth-Ferry, and 
Howden for 8s. it will both become an article of tonnage in a descending 
direction, and a great acquisition to that district; but as that 
neighbourhood has never been in the habit of paying such a high <!-- page 
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>price for 
highway materials, it will probably in the first instance meet with many 
objections, which may be replied to in two ways&mdash;1st, that whatever is
worth doing, is worth well doing; and that the best materials are the 
cheapest;&mdash;and 2dly, if the surveyors and overseers of Northallerton 
and Brompton have, by their experience, established the above fact, and 
found this stone cheaper than that at home, it is reasonable to conclude 
that the surveyors and overseers of the highways in the neighbourhood of 
Cawood, Selby, and Howden, may do the same; for the soil of that district 
is equally fertile and rich as that of Northallerton; and the occupiers of 
it equally opulent&mdash;hence their ability to do well whatever is worth 
doing.</p>

below:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is probable the expense of delivering this stone at Pateley-bridge, 
might be reduced by the application of a Railway from that place to the 
quarry; by this estimate horses are expected to be used; it is also 
possible to remove it from the waggon to the boat at less than is stated 
above.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of Pateley-bridge possessing many water-falls on which
more mills might be built, gave rise to an idea of cutting this 
last-mentioned stone by water-sawing, into scantlings for fire-places, 
hearths, and slabs; but upon an experiment being tried, it was found to 
contain what is termed the dry heads, which cause a division of the parts 
when brought into <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>service, otherwise it yields a beautiful 
polish, and exhibits much of the shell and feather; but notwithstanding 
this last attempt hath failed to augment its value, another in reserve 
still remains of no small moment, which is that of the most excellent</p>
<h3>GREENHOW-HILL LIME.</h3>
<p>In the district where it has long been used as a manure either for 
arable or grassing land, no comment on its superior utility is requisite; 
but to those parts where its presence hitherto hath been forbidden by the 
rugged and steep hills, and to others at too great a distance to warrant 
the expense of a long land carriage, something of its superior quality as a
manure in this place may not, we hope, be deemed unseasonable, especially 
as the carriage of it, when the Railway is constructed, will be an object 
of less notice, and this will be exemplified hereafter.</p>
<p>We have said before, the stone of Greenhow-hill has been submitted to 
analysis, to prove a corresponding property with that of Middleton-Tyas; 
this inquiry was extended to ascertain if they produced similar lime, and 
we have great satisfaction to inform the public this was the case.</p>
<p>We say a great satisfaction, because we have it in proof, that the 
Middleton-Tyas lime is situated in a country, where a knowledge of its 
excellence is not confined to narrow limits by steep and forbidding hills, 
but being more favourably situated, it has been for a great number of 
years, and is now, with increasing demand, conveyed generally 17 or 18 
miles, and in some instances, into the immediate vicinity of other kilns, 
even at 24 miles distance.</p>
<p>The reader will be best able to calculate the expense of this lime to 
the consumer, when he is informed that the cost at the kilns is 12s. per 
chaldron of 32 bushels Winchester, one of which weighs 7st. 8lb.</p>
<p>Under this view of the case, we hope it may not be deemed impertinent to
recommend a trial of this lime, even in districts where lime is plentiful 
and cheap, and which hath been upon proof hitherto satisfactory; and should
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>it 
unexpectedly fail upon arable land, we still beg it may be admitted to a 
trial on grassing land.&nbsp; For the purpose of bleaching it hath been 
carted to Bilton-cum-Harrogate, and used with satisfaction, and frequently 
9 or 10 miles towards Ripley, to places distant from the Nidd lime-kilns 
only 3 or 3&frac12; miles.&nbsp; To say any thing of this lime for the 
purpose of building we are completely unable; for whenever it became a 
topic of conversation, its excellence as a manure alone may be named as one
reason, and that of having at Knaresbro&rsquo; kilns, a kind as well 
adapted for building as any lime probably can be, and at a rate as 
reasonable as circumstances will admit of, may be offered as another 
reason.</p>
<p>Having ascertained that two tons of this lime stone will make one 
chaldron of lime, weighing 1 ton 7 cwt. 2qrs. we give below a statement of 
what it will cost at different points on the line, recommending at the same
time on all occasions the lime-stone to meet the coal.</p>

the above statement it appears the Greenhow-hill lime can be burnt at 
Ribston, for 13s. 6d. per chaldron, a circumstance not unlikely to make it 
in great demand, whenever its properties are known for agricultural 
purposes.</p>
<p>Adverting now to some articles the exact quantity of which is difficult 
to ascertain, such as slate, oak bark, wood, Irish flax and linens, ashes 
and some other kinds of American and colonial produce imported into 
Liverpool, and which will have a cheap conveyance from Liverpool to Skipton
by canal, and naturally become a back carriage from Skipton to 
Pateley-Bridge; as corn, &amp;c. will move in the other direction, and from
Pateley-Bridge to Knaresbro&rsquo;, by the Railway at a much cheaper rate 
than heretofore, and will as a matter of course, increase the tonnage, as 
example will prove:</p>

<p>By the foregoing statement it appears, that when an average of the cost 
is taken, which the present modes of conveyance afford, and contrasted with
the Railway when <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>completed, the latter will have a preference of
6s. 3&frac12;d. per ton, being a reduction of more than ten per cent. upon 
the present charges.</p>
<p>Having now dwelt on the different articles of tonnage in each direction,
with as much accuracy as we are able, and finding the tonnage in the 
ascending direction amount to 31,735 tons per annum, and that in the 
contrary to 4,000; and believing from the best information we are able to 
obtain, that for every two tons moved in an ascending direction, three tons
may be moved in the contrary; consequently we look to building stone, stone
for highways and lime, and some other articles not enumerated, to make up 
the quantity of tonnage required to keep the whole waggons in full work; 
and to produce the greatest possible revenue.</p>
<p>Having enumerated such tonnage as falls within our power of calculation,
and named a source with strong probability of much more; we come next to 
the general summary, and to contrast it with the expense of the project as 
stated by Mr. Telford, wherein we have no doubt, but every ample 
consideration is embraced.</p>

<p>By the above statements it appears the project will cost &pound;92,830; 
and the amount of revenue arising from such tonnage as is comprehensible, 
will amount annually to &pound;7,322. 12s. 6d. which is rather more than 8 
per cent. per annum for the shareholders, independent of 39,090 tons more 
which the works will be able to perform, if required, and which from the 
low price of one penny per ton for Rail dues, for twenty miles, will amount
to &pound;3,257. 10s. 0d. and when only another penny per ton, per mile is 
estimated for waggon dues, this kind of tonnage will be conveyed at a cheap
rate, and delivered in the neighbourhood where it is so much wanted, at 
prices agreeable to the foregoing estimates; a circumstance of itself 
likely to improve the value of all estates, containing the articles of 
stone and lime, and ultimately bring a great increase of tonnage in that 
direction, most desirable in all Railway projects.</p>
<p>In the foregoing estimates it is calculated that the waggons will be 
drawn by horses, at the same time we believe, that loco-motive engines 
might be applied to do the work at a less expense: but not having employed 
an engineer perfectly acquainted therewith, we are not authorized to say 
more on the subject.</p>
<p>With regard to the annual repairs of a Rail-way our engineer, Mr. 
Telford hath not supplied the information; but from other sources we have 
ascertained the repairs are in proportion to the quantity of business done;
upon Rail-ways well constructed, and made strong in the first instance, 
about l-8th of the annual proceeds is highly sufficient, but if the 
castings are light and laid upon timber instead of stone, at least twice 
that sum will be required.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>Having as a Committee, accomplished in the best way we are able, 
what was originally intrusted to our care, (except deviating from a Canal 
to a Rail-way;) we now beg leave to lay the subject before the public, not 
doubting but that public will duly appreciate its utility, and also 
recommend to the Noblemen and Gentlemen who have estates on the line, to 
give it such a consideration as a work of this magnitude deserves, either 
as regards its importance, by the employment it will afford to the 
partially employed labouring poor, during the time the work is in progress,
but more particularly during all the time hereafter; so long as one ton of 
lead, or stone may be found near the higher end of the line; or the river 
Nidd flow in its present course; or the neighbourhood of Selby or Howden 
continue to produce more corn than is sufficient for its population; or as 
may regard its importance in an agricultural view, a sight of which should 
never be lost, nor whatever can promote its advancement, be treated with 
disdain or neglect, but quite the contrary; for upon the best, the 
cheapest, and most skilful method of causing the earth to bring forth 
abundantly, depends in a great measure our national prosperity; it gives a 
plentiful supply at home, will tend to reduce our alarming pauperism, and 
hence promote peace, the welcome inhabitant of every breast; of every 
cottage; of every mansion; of every state; and the safest rampart of every 
throne; for while we consider the soil only as an agent, let us not forget 
it is one of an incorruptible class; and whatever is skilfully committed to
its care is generally repaid tenfold; then it should not be forgotten what 
was the state of the high-roads in this country eighty years ago, they were
chiefly composed of clay; and now contrast that period, with the present, 
and say how much their improvement hath, or hath not, contributed to the 
advancement of that ancient, useful, respectable, and princely profession, 
of agriculture; if this is not denied, then contrast the present highways 
of the district through which the adopted line <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>will pass, remembering 
the many steep and rugged hills, with the present much improved Rail-ways 
where the uniformity of ascent and descent is maintained as a principal 
object, and permit it to come within your calculating powers to show, what 
benefit it may contribute to the perfection of a science on which so much 
wealth and public benefit depend.</p>
<p>Or as may regard its importance by the constant employment it will 
afford to nearly all ages and classes of people, who may be concerned 
directly or indirectly in the manufacture of Yarns, Linens, and Cottons, 
and probably at better wages than are regularly paid at other manufacturing
places, for should a considerable saving of carriage be effected, together 
with the quick dispatch and transport of goods from place to place, as we 
have contemplated; the profits of the masters would be improved, their 
business extended, competition created, and hence wages would be advanced; 
industry would thereby be promoted, and could morality and economy be 
taught by example, then pauperism would only be known by its name.</p>
<p>If there be any doubt, that the completion of this project will not open
new channels for such tillage as the various soils which are contiguous to 
the line require, we are unacquainted with it; because instead of that, we 
believe it will not only facilitate the transport of the various limes as 
may be requisite to suit the different soils, but also afford an 
opportunity of introducing great quantities of manure from the towns of 
Leeds and Hull, into places which the present modes in use never will 
accommodate.</p>
<p>To enumerate all the advantages which a well constructed Rail-way 
possesses over every other mode of conveyance, on lines where the ascent is
great, as in this, would be a work of time, and therefore we shall dismiss 
it after quoting a passage from Dupini&rsquo;s Report to the French 
Government:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The advantages which Iron Rail-ways present are <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>immense.&mdash;England 
owes to them a part of her wealth.&nbsp; Never without them could coal, 
lime, minerals, and other raw materials have been conveyed to such 
distances, and at the same time, at so trifling an expense.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the Noblemen and Gentlemen who have money vested in the security of 
the tolls, arising from the highways contiguous to the line, we beg to 
offer some observations, particularly to those who may feel alarm for their
interests:&mdash;It is the opinion of others, better informed on these 
subjects than ourselves, that instead of reducing the annual amount of 
tolls, they have invariably been found to increase, particularly on such 
roads as cut the line in a transverse direction; but on roads parallel to 
the line, the increase has not been so great; and when it is remembered the
great quantity of tonnage, a project of this kind must require to make it 
profitable, it must be admitted that a disposal of it in all directions 
will necessarily be the case; thus it is accounted for why the tolls have 
increased.</p>
<p>To such Noblemen and Gentlemen who may at some future period (we hope 
not far distant) form themselves into a Committee to ascertain the merits 
of this report, we beg to express a request, which we trust will be treated
with attention, that they will permit all the money advanced towards the 
expenses of the survey already made, to become share money, (if the work 
should go forward) and the subscribers who may not be disposed to purchase 
shares, to have the option of receiving back the sum or sums so advanced by
them.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations

SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
